#Instant massive logout:
#  desc: We want to be able to stop all traffic to the API endpoint with the tokens that were created before a
#    cutover point and make sure that the users have logged in after a different point in time. This may be necessary
#    e.g. to ensure the critical downtime for system migration.
#
#  use cases:
#    - Instant log-off of any number of bearer token, forcing the user to re-login.
