#Authorization Servers issued JWT Tokens Validation:
#  desc: In this case, AFKLM looks to replace ROPC tokens with JWT tokens that are issued by the authorization servers.
#     The difference with the _Custom Header-Based Authentication_ is that the neccesary validation keys are known
#     by the lambda already. However, the endpoint specifies parameters for the validation that the client must meeet
#     in order to be granted accesss.
#
#  use cases:
#    - Replace ROPC and AC tokens with ASFC-issued JWT tokens.
